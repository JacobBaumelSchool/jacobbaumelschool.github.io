		<h1>WIAA: The Worker & The Supervisor</h1>
		<p id="howto"><strong>How to read:</strong> This is a set of 2 stories, whos characters affect each other. On the left is on character, on the right is the other. The middle column with the
			<em>italicized text</em> is common to both of the stories, and should be read with either.</p>
		<h2 id="workerheader">The Worker</h2>
		<h2 id="superheader">The Supervisor</h2>
		<p class="center p1">Today was the day.</p>
		<p class="left p2">The day which the worker would be paid. It had been a month since the last time his supervisor had paid him fairly, but the worker did not have much of a choice. Even after his fellow workers grouped together to discuss it, the supervisor refused to pay them, citing some excuse he had used on a multitude of occasions. Without payment, the worker had not been able to buy food, water, or any of the other bare necessities.</p>
		<p class="right p2">The day which the supervisor would finally seal the business deal of the decade. It had been a long, hard struggle to get to this point, and the supervisor was glad for it to almost be over. He would make so much money from this, he could quit his job and retire early. The supervisor had to pull some money from his worker’s wages to make the deal happen, but he was sure they wouldn't mind. They couldn’t possibly need it as much as he did. The supervisor needed this to happen, even if his workers would complain about not getting paid.</p>
