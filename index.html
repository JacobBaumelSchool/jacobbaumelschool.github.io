		<h1>WIAA: The Worker & The Supervisor</h1>
		<p id="howto"><strong>How to read:</strong> This is a set of 2 stories, whos characters affect each other. On the left is one character, on the right is the other. The middle column with the
			<em>italicized text</em> is common to both of the stories, and should be read with either.</p>
		<h2 id="workerheader">The Worker</h2>
		<h2 id="superheader">The Supervisor</h2>
		<div class="p1">
			<p class="center">Today was the day.</p>
			<p class="left" style="transform: translateY(5%)">The day which the worker would be paid. It had been a month since the last time his supervisor had paid him fairly, but the worker did not have much of a choice. Even after his fellow workers grouped together to discuss it, the supervisor refused to pay them, citing some excuse he had used on a multitude of occasions. Without payment, the worker had not been able to buy food, water, or any of the other bare necessities.</p>
			<p class="right">The day which the supervisor would finally seal the business deal of the decade. It had been a long, hard struggle to get to this point, and the supervisor was glad for it to almost be over. He would make so much money from this, he could even quit his job and retire early. The supervisor had to pull some money from his worker’s wages to make the deal happen, but he was sure they wouldn't mind. They couldn’t possibly need it as much as he did. The supervisor needed this to happen, even if his workers would complain about not getting paid.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p2">
			<p class="center">But this would not stop him. This could not stop him.</p>
			<p class="left" style="transform: translateY(5%)">The worker stood up from his bed, and grabbed his overalls from the floor. They were the only pair he had, and were stained from years of use, but they were enough to keep him going. After getting dressed, he walked to his food stash, to check if anything had been left over. Luckily, there was some bread that had not spoiled, but if the worker wanted to continue surviving, he needed the paycheck from today. Hopefully his supervisor wouldn’t trick him again. Either way, it was time to leave. His workplace was not too far away, but it was still a tiring journey.</p>
			<p class="right">The supervisor stood up from his bed, and wandered towards his closet. He paused, he didn’t know which suit he should wear. Several of them were old and not fashionable anymore, and several were too expensive for the occasion. After deciding on a midrange suit, the supervisor got dressed and made his way downstairs to his kitchen, where his wife was already preparing a large breakfast to get the day started. He said hello and exchanged the typical pleasantries, but was too preoccupied with his plans to make any concerted effort at conversation. Either way, it was time for the supervisor to leave. The worker's workplace was not too far away, but it was still a tiring journey.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p3">
			<p class="left">The crowds of other workers like him made it hard to get around, and took significantly longer than the worker would have liked. “With today's money,” he thought, “I might be able to afford a ride or two.” Eventually, he arrived at the base of the flagpole, which marked the entrance to his workplace, and he paused for a moment, gazing at the American flag waving at the top.</p>
			<p class="right">His private transport struggled to navigate the crowds of other people also heading to work. The supervisor wondered how many of them worked for him, and watched them scurry around like ants. “The ants of success,” the supervisor thought. He eventually reached the entrance to his workplace, and began to hurry inside. The supervisor glanced up at the American flag waving on the flagpole.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p4">
		<p class="center">He wasn’t sure how he felt about the symbol. He respected the progress towards equality and prosperity, and was proud to be an American. He knew about the founding fathers, who had fought so hard against tyranny to save themselves from living miserable lives. He knew about so many other Americans who had persevered and created better lives for themselves. He knew of the countless stories of the self made men, and was excited to finally be able to join them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p5">÷
			<p class="left">However, these opportunities that were supposedly offered to all Americans did not seem to apply equally. The government itself, which was responsible for providing to its citizens, seemed to have trouble realizing the suffering happening below. Stories of self made riches always spread rapidly, and they block the view of those who were still struggling. So many of the workers' fellow Americans were left to their own devices, and had no one to support them in their battle for riches.</p>
			<p class="right">The supervisor was glad to have such unrestricted access to self improvement. He enjoyed the challenge of making his own riches, and of going through some struggle to achieve his dreams. Although the struggle had been intense, the supervisor was proud of how far he had come, and had enjoyed his personal journey, even though there was no doubt there were even tougher challenges ahead.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p6">
			<p class="center">But that never stops anyone from trying. With enough effort, he knew he could become one of the legends.</p>
			<p class="left">The worker looked back at the flag. There were many good things and opportunities for success where he lived, but many of them were not accessible to him. From money, to time, to the energy needed to access them, there were many obstacles in the way of their use. But they would not stop him from trying.</p>
			<p class="right">The supervisor looked back at the flag. How grateful he was for all the opportunities he had been given, and the improvements he had made. From money to friends, he cleared the way of obstacles, and finally had the chance to upgrade his life significantly. Nothing could stop him now.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p7">
			<p class="center">He had worked tirelessly for years to be in a position like he was in today, and to give up now would betray the vision the supervisor held. Giving up never was, and never will be, and option, no matter the cost.</p>
			<p class="left">In fact, if today’s paycheck came in, the worker would finally be able to secure a stable source of food. This would be an extraordinary change in his life, and was something he had been working towards for years. Ever since he was a child, the worker had known what it was like to be hungry. He had always needed to work extra just to live on for another week. More work meant enough food, and enough food meant he could work harder, which meant he might be able to earn enough money to buy something else besides the necessities. Maybe a nice lamp, or a doormat, or perhaps a fresh pair of overalls.</p>
			<p class="right">In fact, there was a chance his business partners would feel even more generous than usual. There was a chance he could convince them to sign an even better deal, which would further secure him financially for the rest of his life. Ever since he was a child, the supervisor dreamed of this day, and now that it was finally upon him, he could hardly contain himself. He had always needed to work just a little harder than everyone else to progress, and more progress meant he was further convinced of what he could accomplish, which inspired the supervisor to work even harder towards his goal.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p8">
			<p class="center">If today went well, the worker would be one step closer to living, and not just surviving. One step at a time, and the worker could accomplish anything.</p>
			<p class="left">All of a sudden, the worker felt someone else crash into him. It was a full speed crash, and he yelled out in surprise. “Watch where you’re going!” the worker heard someone say. He turned around to see who it was, and it was his supervisor! The worker stepped back, and apologized profusely. The supervisor just shook his head, and walked away.</p>
			<p class="right">All of a sudden, the supervisor crashed into someone else. “Watch where you’re going!” the supervisor said. The person tried to apologize, but the supervisor didn’t care. He wouldn't let some random person get in the way of his dreams. He just shook his head and walked away.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p9">
			<p class="left">The worker stood there for a while longer. Why did he apologize to the supervisor? Why did the supervisor get mad at him? The worker wasn’t moving, and the supervisor was at fault. Shouldn’t the supervisor have apologized to him? The more the worker thought about it, the angrier he became. The worker needed very little in return for his work, and needed very little to be happy. Some food, some safety, and maybe something fun every now and then, but he never received pay, yet his supervisor still had the audacity to play the victim. The worker wondered if his supervisor had ever felt hungry. He doubted it. If the supervisor knew the hardships suffered by his employees, perhaps he would be more considerate when withholding their pay again.<br><br><br><br>Either way, it was time to begin the workday. It passed slowly, without much to interest the worker. All he could think about was finally getting paid, and going home. He thought of how he would spend the money. He knew exactly how much he should get, and he had a plan on how to spend it most effectively. Food was, of course, his top priority, but he imagined all the other things he could buy with the leftovers. He knew he wanted to save some in case he had to go another long while without money, but if he planned carefully, he would still have money left in his budget to spice up his life a little. By the end of the day, the worker had a full plan on what he wanted to do with his hard earned money.<br><br><br><br><br>As the workday finished, the worker wandered over to his supervisor's office to pick up his paycheck. He was still lost in the dream, imagining the change that would occur in his life in the next few minutes. There was already a line forming, of all the other workers who were in need of money, each of which with their own hopes, dreams. After starving for so long, any supplement to their lives was an improvement, and a well sought after one. Several minutes passed, and still nothing had happened, with the door to the office remaining locked. Someone decided to try knocking, and a shout was heard from inside that told them to wait, and wait the workers did. They had nowhere better to be than to claim their prize for their work, and they were willing to wait as long as they needed.</p>
			<p class="right">The supervisor continued walking. Why was there always something in the way? Why couldn’t the person have moved out of the way, they obviously knew the supervisor was coming. The more the supervisor thought about it, the angrier he became. The supervisor needed very little to be happy. Only some money to spend in his free time, and a good business deal to work on. These were not too hard to fulfill, yet some people still got in his way. At least the person knew enough to apologize for their ignorance. The supervisor reminded himself of what else was going on that day, and he quickly forgot about the interaction. He made his way into his office, and prepared for his busy day.<br><br><br><br><br>The day passed quickly for the supervisor, who was in meetings all day, and fleshing out plans for domination. He was ruthless in his negotiations, and held back no resources in an attempt to secure the best deal. He knew his worth, and did not stop until his business partners agreed to his plans. Contract after contract, the supervisor secured more and more profit for his future self. By the end of the day, the supervisor could hardly think of anything but his early retirement, and how lavishly he would spend the rest of his life. He decided to go ahead and pull some extra profits from his employees salaries. They would complain, but they couldn’t do anything about it. No one would listen to the few brave souls who would try and work against him.<br><br><br><br>With the day now over, the supervisor could hear employees gathering outside his office. He knew what they were going to ask for. The supervisor had been pulling money from their wages for months now, and they probably were going to ask for their pay, but the supervisor didn’t care, the money had gone to something more useful anyways. One of his workers decided to bang on the door, so the supervisor shouted for them to wait. The supervisor felt somewhat guilty for taking so much from his employees, but he now never had to work again, and he could buy almost anything he wanted, so it was worth it. The supervisor felt that he should at least provide them with a little money, so he wrote up some small payment slips for everyone. It was taking out of his personal riches, but this would hopefully keep the workers quiet, in time for the supervisor to escape.
		</div>
		<div class="p10">
			<p class="center">Several more minutes passed, and the supervisor finally stepped out of the door. “Well,” he said, “due to the expansion of our business, we have had more important things to spend our money on.” The workers looked around the room, as a low grumble began. “Unfortunately,” continued the supervisor, “this means that we are unable to provide everyone’s full payments. You will only receive a portion.” The grumblings continued, and several workers sighed in frustration. Once again, they had been duped. “However, I encourage you to be grateful for what we can provide, and not hold any hard feelings,” finished the supervisor.</p>
			<p class="left">Payment slips were handed out, and the worker looked down at his. It was barely even a full week’s worth, much less the month of payment he was owed. He sighed, and turned to go home. At the very least, he might be able to afford enough food for the week, hopefully enough to last until next week's disappointing pay. So much for his plans, the worker thought. How ironic it was that the supervisor said to be grateful for what the worker got, when he was the one stealing from wages. The worker knew that the supervisor was lying, everyone did. Regardless, the worker was happy he recieved at least something, even if it was not what he was expecting, and not what the worker deserved.</p>
			<p class="right">The supervisor began handing out paychecks. Several of the employees glared at him as he handed their less-than-half payments, but the supervisor didn’t care. He would never see any of these people again in his life. The supervisor winced with each check he handed out, knowing the money it contained could have been his. He could feel every employee looking at him with sad eyes as he handed them barely a week's pay, but the supervisor didn’t care. It was all in the name of progress, and progress the supervisor would have, one way or another. He didn’t care that he had worked hours longer than he should have each day, he didn’t care that his employees were not receiving their fair share, the supervisor was finally free.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="p11" style="margin-bottom: 500px">
			<p class="center">He was glad he hadn’t given up yet. He could never lose hope, he could never stop. As long as there was room to grow, as long as there was a way up, up he would go.</p>
